###Technologies Used:
*MongoDB
*Mongoose
*Angular.js
*Express
*Node.js
*HTML5
*CSS3

###Approach:
I wanted to build a mobile-focused app that dealt with how people interact at bars. I started with building out the basic framework of an Angular.js application after building out some wireframes that would take the user through the complete RoundUp process. Next I tested out some functons to create a group and add/remove friends from it. I decided to make each friend an object in an array of total friends. From there, friends would be shuffled through a shuffle function and each friend with an index of [0] would be displayed on the final page. After every 5th drink, RoundUp reminds users to drink a little bit of water. "Safety First" is the unofficial mission statement of RoundUp. 

###Dependencies:
*Body-Parser
*Express
*Mongoose

###User Stories:
A RoundUp user is someone who enjoys going out with their friends, and being generous with those friends if a web application tells them to. They would use RoundUpso that they don't have to decide which of their friends purchase the next round of refreshments because it can be awkward and tiresome.

###Unsolved Problems/Hurdles:
I had some difficulty implementing certain jQuery animations to my satisfaction. I plan on improving on those further to make my user expereince more exciting. I would also like to incorporate a rideshare API moving forward so that a user can be transferred to an app to request a car if they so choose.
